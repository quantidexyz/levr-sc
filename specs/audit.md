## Critical Findings

### [C-1] PreparedContracts Mapping Never Cleaned Up - Treasury/Staking Reuse Attack

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Fund loss, unauthorized access to other projects' infrastructure

**Description:**

The `_preparedContracts` mapping is never deleted after use. This allows an attacker to:

1. Call `prepareForDeployment()` to create treasury and staking contracts
2. Wait for someone else to call `register()` without preparation (uses zero addresses from empty mapping)
3. Attacker then calls `register()` with a malicious token and reuses the same treasury/staking contracts

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrFactory_v1.sol:51-63
function prepareForDeployment() external override returns (address treasury, address staking) {
    address deployer = _msgSender();

    treasury = address(new LevrTreasury_v1(address(this), trustedForwarder()));
    staking = address(new LevrStaking_v1(trustedForwarder()));

    _preparedContracts[deployer] = ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts({
        treasury: treasury,
        staking: staking
    });

    emit PreparationComplete(deployer, treasury, staking);
}

// LevrFactory_v1.sol:81
ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];
// No cleanup after use!
```

**Recommended Fix:**

```solidity
function register(address clankerToken) external override returns (ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project) {
    Project storage p = _projects[clankerToken];
    require(p.staking == address(0), 'ALREADY_REGISTERED');

    address caller = _msgSender();

    // Only token admin can register
    address tokenAdmin = IClankerToken(clankerToken).admin();
    if (caller != tokenAdmin) {
        revert UnauthorizedCaller();
    }

    // Look up prepared contracts for this caller
    ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];

    // CRITICAL FIX: Delete the prepared contracts to prevent reuse
    delete _preparedContracts[caller];

    // ... rest of function
}
```

---

### [C-2] Staking Initialization Can Be Called on Already-Initialized Contract

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** State corruption, fund loss

**Description:**

The `initialize()` function only checks if `underlying != address(0)`, but it doesn't properly prevent re-initialization if called with the exact same parameters. An attacker could potentially re-initialize an active staking contract if they can meet the conditions.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:52-71
function initialize(
    address underlying_,
    address stakedToken_,
    address treasury_,
    address factory_
) external {
    if (underlying != address(0)) revert(); // Only checks if underlying is set
    if (
        underlying_ == address(0) ||
        stakedToken_ == address(0) ||
        treasury_ == address(0) ||
        factory_ == address(0)
    ) revert ZeroAddress();
    underlying = underlying_;
    stakedToken = stakedToken_;
    treasury = treasury_;
    factory = factory_;
    // ... continues
}
```

**Issue:** The revert on line 58 uses a generic `revert()` without a custom error, making debugging difficult. More importantly, if the factory delegatecall pattern is misused, this could be exploited.

**Recommended Fix:**

```solidity
error AlreadyInitialized();

function initialize(
    address underlying_,
    address stakedToken_,
    address treasury_,
    address factory_
) external {
    if (underlying != address(0)) revert AlreadyInitialized();
    if (
        underlying_ == address(0) ||
        stakedToken_ == address(0) ||
        treasury_ == address(0) ||
        factory_ == address(0)
    ) revert ZeroAddress();

    // Add check to ensure only factory can initialize
    if (_msgSender() != factory_) revert();

    underlying = underlying_;
    stakedToken = stakedToken_;
    treasury = treasury_;
    factory = factory_;
    // ... continues
}
```

## High Severity Findings

### [H-1] Partial Unstake Resets Voting Power - Governance Manipulation

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Governance manipulation, vote farming

**Description:**

The `unstake()` function resets `stakeStartTime[staker] = 0` on ANY unstake, even partial unstakes of 1 wei. This allows a user to:

1. Stake 1000 tokens
2. Wait 1 year (accumulate voting power)
3. Vote on a proposal with VP = 1000 \* 1 year
4. Immediately unstake 1 wei (resets stakeStartTime to 0)
5. Stake again (resets stakeStartTime to current time)
6. User still has 999.999... tokens but VP is now calculated from new timestamp

However, since VP is calculated at proposal creation time via snapshot, the bigger issue is:

- User can repeatedly stake/unstake 1 wei to reset their "start time" and manipulate future VP calculations

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:95-117
function unstake(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant {
    if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    address staker = _msgSender();
    uint256 bal = _staked[staker];
    if (bal < amount) revert InsufficientStake();

    // ... settlement logic ...

    // Governance: Reset stake start time on any unstake (partial or full)
    stakeStartTime[staker] = 0;  // ⚠️ ALWAYS resets, even for 1 wei unstake!

    emit Unstaked(staker, to, amount);
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**

Only reset on full unstake:

```solidity
// Governance: Reset stake start time only on FULL unstake
if (_staked[staker] == 0) {
    stakeStartTime[staker] = 0;
}
```

---

### [H-2] No Reentrancy Protection on Factory.register()

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Potential state corruption, DOS

**Description:**

The `register()` function performs an external delegatecall to `levrDeployer` without reentrancy protection. While the function doesn't transfer tokens, a malicious deployer contract could potentially manipulate state during the delegatecall.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrFactory_v1.sol:66-108
function register(
    address clankerToken
) external override returns (ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project) {
    // No nonReentrant modifier!

    Project storage p = _projects[clankerToken];
    require(p.staking == address(0), 'ALREADY_REGISTERED');

    // ... checks ...

    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = levrDeployer.delegatecall(data);
    require(success, 'DEPLOY_FAILED');

    project = abi.decode(returnData, (ILevrFactory_v1.Project));

    // Store in registry
    _projects[clankerToken] = project;

    emit Registered(/* ... */);
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**

Add reentrancy protection:

```solidity
function register(
    address clankerToken
) external override nonReentrant returns (ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project) {
    // ... rest of function
}
```

---

### [H-3] VP Snapshot Timing Allows Post-Creation Stakes to Vote

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Governance manipulation, flash loan attacks

**Description:**

The VP calculation uses `proposal.createdAt` for the snapshot, but voting doesn't start until `proposal.votingStartsAt` (which is `cycle.proposalWindowEnd`). This creates a window where:

1. Proposal is created at time T
2. Voting starts at time T + proposalWindow
3. User stakes between T and T + proposalWindow
4. User's VP is calculated as 0 (because `startTime >= proposal.createdAt`)

However, the check `startTime >= proposal.createdAt` should be `>` not `>=`. More critically, users who stake during the proposal window can still call `vote()` even though they have 0 VP. This wastes gas and pollutes vote receipts.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrGovernor_v1.sol:328-349
function _calculateVPAtSnapshot(
    uint256 proposalId,
    address user
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    ILevrGovernor_v1.Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalId];

    uint256 balance = IERC20(stakedToken).balanceOf(user);
    if (balance == 0) return 0;

    uint256 startTime = ILevrStaking_v1(staking).stakeStartTime(user);

    // If user staked after proposal was created, they have 0 VP for this proposal
    if (startTime == 0 || startTime >= proposal.createdAt) {  // ⚠️ Should be > not >=
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 timeStaked = proposal.createdAt - startTime;
    return balance * timeStaked;
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**

1. Change the comparison to strictly greater than
2. Add check in `vote()` to prevent 0 VP votes

```solidity
function _calculateVPAtSnapshot(
    uint256 proposalId,
    address user
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    ILevrGovernor_v1.Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalId];

    uint256 balance = IERC20(stakedToken).balanceOf(user);
    if (balance == 0) return 0;

    uint256 startTime = ILevrStaking_v1(staking).stakeStartTime(user);

    // If user staked after proposal was created, they have 0 VP
    if (startTime == 0 || startTime > proposal.createdAt) {  // ✅ Fixed
        return 0;
    }

    uint256 timeStaked = proposal.createdAt - startTime;
    return balance * timeStaked;
}

function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    address voter = _msgSender();
    // ... existing checks ...

    uint256 votes = _calculateVPAtSnapshot(proposalId, voter);

    // ✅ NEW: Prevent 0 VP votes
    if (votes == 0) revert InsufficientVotingPower();

    // ... rest of function
}
```

---

### [H-4] Treasury Approval Not Revoked After applyBoost

**Contract:** `LevrTreasury_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Unlimited approval vulnerability

**Description:**

The `applyBoost()` function approves the staking contract for `amount` tokens, but if the `accrueFromTreasury()` call fails or uses less than `amount`, the approval is not revoked. This leaves a permanent approval that could be exploited.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrTreasury_v1.sol:48-57
function applyBoost(uint256 amount) external onlyGovernor nonReentrant {
    if (amount == 0) revert ILevrTreasury_v1.InvalidAmount();

    ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).getProjectContracts(
        underlying
    );

    // ⚠️ Approves full amount
    IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, amount);

    // If this fails or uses less than amount, approval remains!
    ILevrStaking_v1(project.staking).accrueFromTreasury(underlying, amount, true);
}
```

**Recommended Fix:**

Use `forceApprove` or reset approval after:

```solidity
function applyBoost(uint256 amount) external onlyGovernor nonReentrant {
    if (amount == 0) revert ILevrTreasury_v1.InvalidAmount();

    ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).getProjectContracts(
        underlying
    );

    // Approve exact amount
    IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, amount);

    // Call staking
    ILevrStaking_v1(project.staking).accrueFromTreasury(underlying, amount, true);

    // ✅ Reset approval to 0 after
    IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, 0);
}
```

---

## Medium Severity Findings

### [M-1] Register Without Preparation Uses Zero Addresses

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Failed deployments, confusion

**Description:**

If a user calls `register()` without first calling `prepareForDeployment()`, the code retrieves an empty `PreparedContracts` struct from the mapping (all zero addresses) and passes them to the deployer. This will likely cause the deployment to fail in the deployer logic, but the error handling is unclear.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrFactory_v1.sol:81
ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];
// If caller never called prepareForDeployment(), prepared.treasury = address(0)

bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    'deployProject(address,address,address,address,address)',
    clankerToken,
    prepared.treasury,  // Could be address(0)
    prepared.staking,   // Could be address(0)
    address(this),
    trustedForwarder()
);
```

**Recommended Fix:**

Add explicit check or auto-deploy if not prepared:

```solidity
ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];

// If user didn't prepare, deploy fresh contracts
if (prepared.treasury == address(0)) {
    prepared.treasury = address(new LevrTreasury_v1(address(this), trustedForwarder()));
    prepared.staking = address(new LevrStaking_v1(trustedForwarder()));
}
```

### [M-2] Streaming Rewards Lost if No Stakers During Window

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Reward loss for stakers

**Description:**

The streaming mechanism vests rewards linearly over time. If there are no stakers during the streaming window, or if all stakers unstake, rewards are permanently lost. The code acknowledges this in a comment but it's a design issue.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:492-495
uint256 vestAmount = (total * (to - from)) / duration;
if (_totalStaked > 0 && vestAmount > 0) {
    ILevrStaking_v1.RewardInfo storage info = _rewardInfo[token];
    info.accPerShare += (vestAmount * ACC_SCALE) / _totalStaked;
}
// Advance last update regardless; if no stakers, the stream time is consumed
_lastUpdateByToken[token] = to;  // ⚠️ Time consumed even if no stakers
```

**Impact:** In a scenario where all stakers exit temporarily, rewards are lost.

**Recommended Fix:**

Consider pausing the stream when `_totalStaked == 0`:

```solidity
function _settleStreamingForToken(address token) internal {
    uint64 start = _streamStartByToken[token];
    uint64 end = _streamEndByToken[token];
    if (end == 0 || start == 0) return;

    // ✅ NEW: Don't consume time if no stakers
    if (_totalStaked == 0) return;

    uint64 last = _lastUpdateByToken[token];
    // ... rest of function
}
```

---

### [M-3] Failed Governance Cycles Cannot Recover

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Governance gridlock

**Description:**

If a governance cycle completes but no proposal meets quorum/approval, or the winner is never executed, the cycle remains in limbo. There's no mechanism to force-start a new cycle or clear failed cycles.

**Issue:**

- `execute()` calls `_startNewCycle()` only on successful execution
- If execution fails or no one executes, the cycle can only advance when someone creates a new proposal (which checks `_needsNewCycle()`)
- This could lead to periods of governance inactivity

**Recommended Fix:**

Add a public function to start new cycle:

```solidity
function startNewCycle() external {
    if (_currentCycleId == 0 || _needsNewCycle()) {
        _startNewCycle();
    } else {
        revert CycleStillActive();
    }
}
```

---

### [M-4] Quorum Check Uses Balance, Not VP

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Governance design inconsistency

**Description:**

The quorum check uses `totalBalanceVoted` (raw sToken balance) while vote tallying uses VP (time-weighted). This creates an asymmetry where:

- New stakers can contribute to quorum without contributing to vote outcome
- Long-term stakers have high VP but same quorum weight as new stakers

This is documented in code but may not be the intended behavior.

**Code:**

```solidity
// LevrGovernor_v1.sol:370-385
function _meetsQuorum(uint256 proposalId) internal view returns (bool) {
    ILevrGovernor_v1.Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalId];
    uint16 quorumBps = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).quorumBps();

    if (quorumBps == 0) return true;

    // Quorum is based on participation rate: balance that voted / total supply
    // Not based on VP (which includes time weighting)
    uint256 totalSupply = IERC20(stakedToken).totalSupply();
    if (totalSupply == 0) return false;

    uint256 requiredQuorum = (totalSupply * quorumBps) / 10_000;

    return proposal.totalBalanceVoted >= requiredQuorum;  // ⚠️ Uses balance, not VP
}
```

**Recommendation:**

Document this clearly in governance docs or consider using VP for both quorum and approval.

---

### [M-5] ClankerFeeLocker Claim Logic Has Multiple Fallbacks

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Failed reward claims, locked rewards

**Description:**

The `_claimFromClankerFeeLocker()` function tries multiple strategies to claim fees but doesn't handle all edge cases. If fees are registered under an unexpected owner, they may be permanently stuck.

**Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:335-386
function _claimFromClankerFeeLocker(address token) internal {
    // ... gets metadata ...

    // Try claiming with staking contract as feeOwner first
    try IClankerFeeLocker(metadata.feeLocker).availableFees(address(this), token) returns (
        uint256 availableFees
    ) {
        if (availableFees > 0) {
            IClankerFeeLocker(metadata.feeLocker).claim(address(this), token);
            return;
        }
    } catch {
        // Continue to next attempt
    }

    // Try claiming with LP locker as feeOwner
    if (metadata.lpLocker != address(0)) {
        // ... complex fallback logic ...
    }
}
```

**Issue:** If fees are registered under neither address, they're stuck.

**Recommendation:**

Add administrative function to specify feeOwner:

```solidity
mapping(address => address) public feeOwnerOverride;

function setFeeOwnerOverride(address token, address feeOwner) external {
    require(_msgSender() == governor, "ONLY_GOVERNOR");
    feeOwnerOverride[token] = feeOwner;
}
```

---

## Low Severity Findings

### [L-1] No Mechanism to Recover Accidentally Sent ERC20 Tokens

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Lost funds

**Description:**

If users accidentally send ERC20 tokens to contracts (other than expected tokens), they cannot be recovered. Only `LevrForwarder_v1` has `withdrawTrappedETH()` for ETH.

**Recommendation:**

Add recovery function for unexpected tokens in Treasury (governor-controlled):

```solidity
function recoverToken(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyGovernor {
    require(token != underlying, "Cannot recover underlying");
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
}
```

---

### [L-2] Missing Events for Critical State Changes

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Poor off-chain monitoring

**Description:**

Several critical state changes lack events:

- `LevrFactory_v1.prepareForDeployment()` emits event ✅
- `LevrStaking_v1.initialize()` - no event ❌
- `LevrTreasury_v1.initialize()` emits event ✅
- `LevrStaking_v1.accrueRewards()` - no event for claim from feeLocker ❌

**Recommendation:**

Add events for all state changes.

---

### [L-3] Generic revert() Statements Make Debugging Difficult

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Poor developer experience

**Description:**

Several places use `revert()` without custom errors:

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:58
if (underlying != address(0)) revert();

// LevrTreasury_v1.sol:27
if (governor != address(0)) revert();
if (_msgSender() != factory) revert();
```

**Recommendation:**

Replace all generic `revert()` with custom errors:

```solidity
error AlreadyInitialized();
error OnlyFactory();

if (underlying != address(0)) revert AlreadyInitialized();
if (_msgSender() != factory) revert OnlyFactory();
```

---

## Informational Findings

### [I-1] Unused \_calculateProtocolFee Function

**Contract:** `LevrTreasury_v1.sol`  
**Location:** Lines 71-74

The `_calculateProtocolFee()` function is defined but never used in the contract.

**Recommendation:** Remove if not needed, or implement protocol fee mechanism.

---

### [I-2] Magic Numbers Should Be Constants

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Examples:**

- `10_000` for basis points calculations (use `constant BPS_DENOMINATOR = 10_000`)
- `365 days` in APR calculation (use `constant SECONDS_PER_YEAR = 365 days`)
- `1e18` for ACC_SCALE (already constant ✅)

**Recommendation:** Define all magic numbers as named constants.

---

### [I-3] Inconsistent Error Naming Convention

Some contracts use `OnlyGovernor()` error while others use `require(msg.sender == governor, "ONLY_GOVERNOR")`.

**Recommendation:** Standardize on custom errors throughout for gas efficiency.

---

### [I-4] Missing NatSpec Documentation

Several internal functions lack NatSpec comments:

- `_settleStreamingForToken()`
- `_increaseDebtForAll()`
- `_updateDebtAll()`

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive NatSpec for all functions.

---

### [I-5] Delegatecall Pattern Could Be Simplified

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`

The delegatecall pattern with separate `LevrDeployer_v1` adds complexity. Consider whether deployment logic could be inlined into factory.

**Trade-offs:**

- Current: Keeps factory bytecode small, more gas efficient deployment
- Alternative: Simpler architecture but larger factory contract

---

## Gas Optimization Findings

### [G-1] Cache Array Length in Loops

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`

```solidity
// Multiple locations
uint256 len = _rewardTokens.length;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {  // ✅ Good - cached
```

Already optimized! ✅

---

### [G-2] Use Custom Errors Instead of Require Strings

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`

```solidity
require(p.staking == address(0), 'ALREADY_REGISTERED');
require(success, 'DEPLOY_FAILED');
require(available >= amount, 'INSUFFICIENT_AVAILABLE');
```

Custom errors save gas. Already using them in some places.

**Recommendation:** Convert all `require(condition, "string")` to custom errors.

---

### [G-3] Pack Struct Variables

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`

```solidity
struct Cycle {
    uint256 proposalWindowStart;
    uint256 proposalWindowEnd;
    uint256 votingWindowEnd;
    bool executed;
}
```

Could pack `bool executed` with timestamps if using uint64/uint128 for timestamps.

---

### [G-4] Use Unchecked for Counter Increments

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`

```solidity
proposalId = ++_proposalCount;
cycleId = ++_currentCycleId;
```

Could use `unchecked` for these counter increments (won't overflow in practice).

---

## Architectural Recommendations

### 1. Add Pause Mechanism

Consider adding emergency pause functionality to critical contracts in case of discovered vulnerabilities post-deployment.

### 2. Add Timelock to Factory Config Updates

The `updateConfig()` function allows immediate changes to critical parameters. Consider adding a timelock.

### 3. Consider Upgradeability

Contracts are not upgradeable. For v1 deployment, consider using a proxy pattern for easier bug fixes.

### 4. Add Comprehensive Integration Tests

While unit tests exist, ensure comprehensive e2e tests cover:

- Full lifecycle: prepare → register → stake → propose → vote → execute
- Attack scenarios: front-running, flash loans, griefing
- Edge cases: no stakers, zero votes, cycle transitions

### 5. Formal Verification

Consider formal verification for critical invariants:

- Reward accounting: `sum(user_rewards) <= reward_reserve`
- Escrow accounting: `sum(user_stakes) == escrow_balance`
- VP calculations: VP always deterministic for given timestamp

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases to Add

1. **Test PreparedContracts cleanup** (fixes [C-1])
2. **Test partial unstake VP preservation** (fixes [H-1])
3. **Test register() reentrancy** (fixes [H-2])
4. **Test VP timing edge cases** (fixes [H-3])
5. **Test treasury approval cleanup** (fixes [H-4])
6. **Test streaming with zero stakers**
7. **Test cycle recovery after failed execution**
8. **Test reward accounting under all scenarios**

### Fuzzing Recommendations

Use Echidna or Foundry fuzzing for:

- Reward accounting invariants
- VP calculation correctness
- Governance cycle state transitions

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix [C-1] - PreparedContracts cleanup
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Fix [C-2] - Initialization protection
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix [H-1] - Partial unstake VP reset
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix [H-2] - Add reentrancy protection to register()
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix [H-3] - VP snapshot timing
- [ ] **HIGH**: Fix [H-4] - Treasury approval cleanup
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Address [M-1] through [M-5] based on risk tolerance
- [ ] Add comprehensive test cases for all fixes
- [ ] Run full fuzzing test suite
- [ ] Deploy to testnet and run integration tests
- [ ] Consider external audit by professional firm
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for deployed contracts
- [ ] Prepare emergency response plan
- [ ] Document all known issues and limitations
- [ ] Set up multisig for admin functions

---

## Conclusion

The Levr V1 protocol has a solid architectural foundation with good use of OpenZeppelin libraries and reentrancy protection. However, **2 CRITICAL and 4 HIGH severity issues must be resolved before production deployment.**

The most critical issues are:

1. PreparedContracts mapping cleanup vulnerability
2. Partial unstake governance manipulation
3. VP timing and snapshot issues
4. Treasury approval management

All critical and high severity issues have clear remediation paths outlined above. After addressing these issues and completing comprehensive testing, the protocol should be ready for production deployment.

**Recommendation:** Fix all CRITICAL and HIGH severity issues, add recommended test cases, and consider a professional audit before mainnet deployment.
