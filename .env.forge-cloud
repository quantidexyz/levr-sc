# Forge Cloud Configuration for Coverage Analysis
# This environment enables efficient coverage testing on cloud infrastructure

# Profile for coverage (optimized for cloud)
# Usage: FOUNDRY_PROFILE=coverage forge coverage --match-path "test/unit/*.t.sol" --ir-minimum

# Enable parallel execution (for cloud)
FOUNDRY_PARALLEL=true

# Set memory limits for cloud environment (adjust as needed)
FOUNDRY_MAX_MEMORY=4096

# Disable cache to ensure clean runs
FOUNDRY_NO_CACHE=false

# Use minimal IR for faster compilation in cloud
# Set via FOUNDRY_PROFILE=dev in actual commands

# Optional: Remote RPC endpoints (for fork testing)
