- **Always** run tests in -vvv verbose mode.
- **Always** tests handle fork internally.
- **Never** pass fork url in test command.
- **Always** run relevent test cases/files/folders.
- **Intelligently** determine if a test is written just to make the test pass, even when the source code is actually incorrect.
