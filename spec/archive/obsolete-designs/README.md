# Obsolete Design Documents Archive

**Date:** Current consolidation (based on dev branch state)  
**Purpose:** Archive of design documents from transferable token design iteration

---

## Why These Files Are Archived

These documents were created during an earlier design iteration that explored **transferable staked tokens**. The current implementation uses **non-transferable tokens** (99 tests cover this design).

### Archived Files

1. **CONTRACT_TRANSFER_REWARDS_FINAL.md** - Final design for transferable token reward transfers
2. **REWARDS_BELONG_TO_ADDRESS_DESIGN.md** - Design exploration for address-based reward ownership
3. **TRANSFER_REWARDS_DESIGN_ANALYSIS.md** - Analysis of reward transfer mechanisms
4. **FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md** (Jan 2025) - Implementation report for transferable tokens
5. **FUND_STUCK_ANALYSIS_COMPLETE.md** - Analysis for transferable token scenarios
6. **STREAMING_SIMPLIFICATION_PROPOSAL.md** - Proposals related to transferable token streaming
7. **NON_TRANSFERABLE_EDGE_CASES.md** - Edge case analysis from transferable token exploration

### Current Implementation

- **Staked tokens are NON-TRANSFERABLE** ✅
- **99 tests cover non-transferable design** ✅
- **All edge cases documented in main spec** ✅

### When to Reference These Files

These archived documents are useful for:
- Historical context on design decisions
- Understanding why non-transferable was chosen
- Design exploration patterns and methodology

### Current Documentation

For current implementation details, see:
- `spec/HISTORICAL_FIXES.md` - Current bug fixes and design changes
- `spec/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- `spec/AUDIT.md` - Current security audit
- `spec/USER_FLOWS.md` - Current user flows

**Archived:** Current consolidation date  
**Reason:** Superseded by non-transferable token implementation
