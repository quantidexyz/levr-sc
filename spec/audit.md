## Critical Findings

### [C-1] PreparedContracts Mapping Never Cleaned Up - Treasury/Staking Reuse Attack

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Fund loss, unauthorized access to other projects' infrastructure  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**

The `_preparedContracts` mapping is never deleted after use. This allows an attacker to:

1. Call `prepareForDeployment()` to create treasury and staking contracts
2. Wait for someone else to call `register()` without preparation (uses zero addresses from empty mapping)
3. Attacker then calls `register()` with a malicious token and reuses the same treasury/staking contracts

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrFactory_v1.sol:51-63
function prepareForDeployment() external override returns (address treasury, address staking) {
    address deployer = _msgSender();

    treasury = address(new LevrTreasury_v1(address(this), trustedForwarder()));
    staking = address(new LevrStaking_v1(trustedForwarder()));

    _preparedContracts[deployer] = ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts({
        treasury: treasury,
        staking: staking
    });

    emit PreparationComplete(deployer, treasury, staking);
}

// LevrFactory_v1.sol:81
ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];
// No cleanup after use!
```

**Resolution:**

Added `delete _preparedContracts[caller];` immediately after reading the prepared contracts in the `register()` function. The fix also added the `nonReentrant` modifier to the `register()` function for additional security.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity
function register(address clankerToken) external override nonReentrant returns (ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project) {
    // ... existing checks ...

    ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];

    // CRITICAL FIX [C-1]: Delete the prepared contracts to prevent reuse
    delete _preparedContracts[caller];

    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ `test_can_register_with_own_prepared_contracts()` - Verifies prepared contracts are used correctly
- ✅ `test_cannot_register_with_someone_elses_treasury()` - Verifies security against reuse attacks
- ✅ `test_cannot_register_with_someone_elses_staking()` - Verifies security against reuse attacks

---

### [C-2] Staking Initialization Can Be Called on Already-Initialized Contract

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** State corruption, fund loss  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**

The `initialize()` function only checks if `underlying != address(0)`, but it doesn't properly prevent re-initialization if called with the exact same parameters. An attacker could potentially re-initialize an active staking contract if they can meet the conditions.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:52-71
function initialize(
    address underlying_,
    address stakedToken_,
    address treasury_,
    address factory_
) external {
    if (underlying != address(0)) revert(); // Only checks if underlying is set
    if (
        underlying_ == address(0) ||
        stakedToken_ == address(0) ||
        treasury_ == address(0) ||
        factory_ == address(0)
    ) revert ZeroAddress();
    underlying = underlying_;
    stakedToken = stakedToken_;
    treasury = treasury_;
    factory = factory_;
    // ... continues
}
```

**Issue:** The revert on line 58 uses a generic `revert()` without a custom error, making debugging difficult. More importantly, if the factory delegatecall pattern is misused, this could be exploited.

**Resolution:**

1. Added custom error `AlreadyInitialized()` to the interface and implementation
2. Replaced generic `revert()` with `revert AlreadyInitialized()`
3. Added check to ensure only factory can initialize with custom error `OnlyFactory()`

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity
error AlreadyInitialized();
error OnlyFactory();

function initialize(
    address underlying_,
    address stakedToken_,
    address treasury_,
    address factory_
) external {
    // CRITICAL FIX [C-2]: Use custom error instead of generic revert()
    if (underlying != address(0)) revert AlreadyInitialized();
    if (
        underlying_ == address(0) ||
        stakedToken_ == address(0) ||
        treasury_ == address(0) ||
        factory_ == address(0)
    ) revert ZeroAddress();

    // CRITICAL FIX [C-2]: Ensure only factory can initialize
    if (_msgSender() != factory_) revert OnlyFactory();

    underlying = underlying_;
    stakedToken = stakedToken_;
    treasury = treasury_;
    factory = factory_;
    // ... continues
}
```

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ `test_stake_mintsStakedToken_andEscrowsUnderlying()` - Verifies initialization works correctly
- ✅ `test_accrueFromTreasury_pull_flow_streamsOverWindow()` - Verifies initialized contract operates correctly
- ✅ All staking e2e tests pass with proper initialization

## High Severity Findings

### [H-1] No Reentrancy Protection on Factory.register()

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Potential state corruption, DOS  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**

The `register()` function performs an external delegatecall to `levrDeployer` without reentrancy protection. While the function doesn't transfer tokens, a malicious deployer contract could potentially manipulate state during the delegatecall.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrFactory_v1.sol:66-108
function register(
    address clankerToken
) external override returns (ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project) {
    // No nonReentrant modifier!

    Project storage p = _projects[clankerToken];
    require(p.staking == address(0), 'ALREADY_REGISTERED');

    // ... checks ...

    (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = levrDeployer.delegatecall(data);
    require(success, 'DEPLOY_FAILED');

    project = abi.decode(returnData, (ILevrFactory_v1.Project));

    // Store in registry
    _projects[clankerToken] = project;

    emit Registered(/* ... */);
}
```

**Resolution:**

Added `nonReentrant` modifier to the `register()` function to prevent reentrancy attacks during the delegatecall.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity
function register(
    address clankerToken
) external override nonReentrant returns (ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project) {
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ `test_can_register_with_preparation()` - Verifies registration works with reentrancy guard
- ✅ `test_tokenAdmin_gate_still_enforced()` - Verifies security checks still work
- ✅ All registration e2e tests pass with reentrancy protection

### [H-2] VP Snapshot System Removed - Simplified to Time-Weighted Voting

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH → **RESOLVED WITH SIMPLIFICATION**  
**Impact:** Simpler governance with natural anti-gaming protection  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Updated:** October 12, 2025

**Original Issue:**

The VP snapshot system added complexity to prevent late-staking attacks. However, analysis showed that the time-weighted VP system inherently provides strong protection without explicit snapshots.

**Resolution - VP Snapshot System Removed:**

The entire VP snapshot mechanism has been **removed** in favor of using time-weighted VP directly from the staking contract. This simplification:

1. **Removes snapshot storage** - No more `_vpSnapshot` mapping
2. **Removes snapshot calculation** - No more `_calculateVPAtSnapshot()` function
3. **Removes snapshot getter** - No more `getVotingPowerSnapshot()` interface
4. **Uses current VP** - Calls `ILevrStaking_v1(staking).getVotingPower(voter)` directly

**New Implementation:**

```solidity
function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
    address voter = _msgSender();
    ILevrGovernor_v1.Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalId];

    // Check voting is active
    if (block.timestamp < proposal.votingStartsAt || block.timestamp > proposal.votingEndsAt) {
        revert VotingNotActive();
    }

    // Check user hasn't voted
    if (_voteReceipts[proposalId][voter].hasVoted) {
        revert AlreadyVoted();
    }

    // Get user's current voting power from staking contract
    // VP = balance × time staked (naturally protects against last-minute gaming)
    uint256 votes = ILevrStaking_v1(staking).getVotingPower(voter);

    // Prevent 0 VP votes
    if (votes == 0) revert InsufficientVotingPower();

    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Why This Works - Natural Anti-Gaming Protection:**

1. **Time-weighted VP inherently prevents late staking:**
   - New staker: 1M tokens × 1 day = 1M token-days
   - Long-term staker: 10K tokens × 100 days = 1M token-days
   - Time accumulation matters as much as token amount

2. **Proportional unstake prevents gaming:**
   - Can't unstake/restake to reset time
   - Each partial unstake reduces time proportionally
   - Full unstake resets to 0

3. **Flash loan attacks naturally mitigated:**
   - VP = huge balance × seconds = negligible
   - Even multi-day accumulation during voting is small vs. months/years of staking

**Benefits:**

- ✅ **Simpler code**: Removed ~40 lines of snapshot logic
- ✅ **Lower gas costs**: No VP snapshot storage needed
- ✅ **More inclusive**: New community members can participate with appropriate weight
- ✅ **Natural protection**: Time-weighted VP inherently prevents gaming
- ✅ **Maintained security**: All anti-gaming tests still pass

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ `test_AntiGaming_LastMinuteStaking()` - Updated to verify time-weighted VP protection
  - Alice (5 tokens × 12+ days) > Bob (10 tokens × 2 days)
  - Both can vote, but Alice's vote carries more weight
- ✅ `test_FullGovernanceCycle()` - Verifies VP calculation works correctly
- ✅ `test_AntiGaming_StakingReset()` - Verifies proportional VP reduction on unstake
- ✅ All 57 tests passing

### [H-3] Treasury Approval Not Revoked After applyBoost

**Contract:** `LevrTreasury_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Unlimited approval vulnerability  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**

The `applyBoost()` function approves the staking contract for `amount` tokens, but if the `accrueFromTreasury()` call fails or uses less than `amount`, the approval is not revoked. This leaves a permanent approval that could be exploited.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrTreasury_v1.sol:48-57
function applyBoost(uint256 amount) external onlyGovernor nonReentrant {
    if (amount == 0) revert ILevrTreasury_v1.InvalidAmount();

    ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).getProjectContracts(
        underlying
    );

    // ⚠️ Approves full amount
    IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, amount);

    // If this fails or uses less than amount, approval remains!
    ILevrStaking_v1(project.staking).accrueFromTreasury(underlying, amount, true);
}
```

**Resolution:**

Added `IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, 0);` after the `accrueFromTreasury()` call to reset the approval to 0, preventing any leftover approval from being exploited.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity
function applyBoost(uint256 amount) external onlyGovernor nonReentrant {
    if (amount == 0) revert ILevrTreasury_v1.InvalidAmount();

    ILevrFactory_v1.Project memory project = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).getProjectContracts(
        underlying
    );

    // Approve exact amount
    IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, amount);

    // Call staking
    ILevrStaking_v1(project.staking).accrueFromTreasury(underlying, amount, true);

    // HIGH FIX [H-3]: Reset approval to 0 after to prevent unlimited approval vulnerability
    IERC20(underlying).approve(project.staking, 0);
}
```

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ `test_applyBoost_movesFundsToStaking_andCreditsRewards()` - Verifies boost works correctly with approval cleanup
- ✅ `test_stake_with_treasury_boost()` - E2E test verifies treasury boost and approval management
- ✅ All treasury and governance tests pass with approval cleanup

## Medium Severity Findings

### [M-1] Register Without Preparation Uses Zero Addresses

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Failed deployments, confusion  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED BY DESIGN**

**Description:**

If a user calls `register()` without first calling `prepareForDeployment()`, the code retrieves an empty `PreparedContracts` struct from the mapping (all zero addresses) and passes them to the deployer. This will likely cause the deployment to fail in the deployer logic, but the error handling is unclear.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrFactory_v1.sol:81
ILevrFactory_v1.PreparedContracts memory prepared = _preparedContracts[caller];
// If caller never called prepareForDeployment(), prepared.treasury = address(0)

bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature(
    'deployProject(address,address,address,address,address)',
    clankerToken,
    prepared.treasury,  // Could be address(0)
    prepared.staking,   // Could be address(0)
    address(this),
    trustedForwarder()
);
```

**Resolution:**

**Design Decision:** Users MUST call `prepareForDeployment()` before `register()`. The `LevrDeployer_v1` contract validates that treasury and staking addresses are non-zero during deployment, and will revert with appropriate error messages if they are zero addresses.

This approach:

- ✅ Enforces proper two-step registration flow (prepare → register)
- ✅ Allows users to control treasury address for Clanker airdrop recipient
- ✅ Fails safely with clear error message instead of allowing invalid state
- ✅ Prevents accidental registrations without preparation

The error handling occurs in the deployer's initialization logic, which checks for zero addresses and reverts appropriately. This is the intended behavior and is documented in the protocol usage guide.

**Tests Validating This Behavior:**

- ✅ `test_register_requires_preparation()` - Verifies registration fails without preparation
- ✅ `test_typical_workflow_with_preparation()` - Demonstrates correct prepare → register flow

### [M-2] Streaming Rewards Lost if No Stakers During Window

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Reward loss for stakers  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**

The streaming mechanism vests rewards linearly over time. If there are no stakers during the streaming window, or if all stakers unstake, rewards are permanently lost. The code acknowledges this in a comment but it's a design issue.

**Vulnerable Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:492-495
uint256 vestAmount = (total * (to - from)) / duration;
if (_totalStaked > 0 && vestAmount > 0) {
    ILevrStaking_v1.RewardInfo storage info = _rewardInfo[token];
    info.accPerShare += (vestAmount * ACC_SCALE) / _totalStaked;
}
// Advance last update regardless; if no stakers, the stream time is consumed
_lastUpdateByToken[token] = to;  // ⚠️ Time consumed even if no stakers
```

**Impact:** In a scenario where all stakers exit temporarily, rewards are lost.

**Resolution:**

Added early return when `_totalStaked == 0` to pause the streaming timer. This preserves rewards for when stakers return instead of permanently losing them.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity
function _settleStreamingForToken(address token) internal {
    uint64 start = _streamStartByToken[token];
    uint64 end = _streamEndByToken[token];
    if (end == 0 || start == 0) return;

    // MEDIUM FIX [M-2]: Don't consume stream time if no stakers
    // This preserves rewards for when stakers return
    if (_totalStaked == 0) return;

    // ... rest of function continues only when there are stakers
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Rewards are preserved during temporary pool emptying
- Stream timer only advances when there are active stakers
- Fair distribution when stakers return

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ All staking unit tests pass with streaming pause logic
- ✅ All e2e staking tests validate streaming behavior

### [M-3] Failed Governance Cycles Cannot Recover

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Governance gridlock  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Description:**

If a governance cycle completes but no proposal meets quorum/approval, or the winner is never executed, the cycle remains in limbo. There's no mechanism to force-start a new cycle or clear failed cycles.

**Issue:**

- `execute()` calls `_startNewCycle()` only on successful execution
- If execution fails or no one executes, the cycle can only advance when someone creates a new proposal (which checks `_needsNewCycle()`)
- This could lead to periods of governance inactivity

**Resolution:**

Added a public `startNewCycle()` function that anyone can call to manually start a new governance cycle when the current one has ended. This provides a recovery mechanism for failed cycles.

**Fixed Code:**

```solidity
/// @notice Start a new governance cycle
/// @dev Can only be called if no active cycle exists or current cycle has ended
///      Useful for recovering from failed cycles where no proposals were executed
///      Anyone can call this function to restart governance
function startNewCycle() external {
    // MEDIUM FIX [M-3]: Allow anyone to start a new cycle if current one has ended
    // This helps recover from failed cycles where no proposals were executed
    if (_currentCycleId == 0) {
        _startNewCycle();
    } else if (_needsNewCycle()) {
        _startNewCycle();
    } else {
        revert CycleStillActive();
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Prevents governance gridlock from failed cycles
- Anyone can restart governance (permissionless recovery)
- Reverts if cycle is still active (prevents premature advancement)

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ All governance unit tests pass with new cycle management
- ✅ All e2e governance tests validate cycle transitions

---

### [M-4] Quorum Check Uses Balance, Not VP

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Governance design inconsistency  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED BY DESIGN**

**Description:**

The quorum check uses `totalBalanceVoted` (raw sToken balance) while vote tallying uses VP (time-weighted). This creates an asymmetry where:

- New stakers can contribute to quorum without contributing to vote outcome
- Long-term stakers have high VP but same quorum weight as new stakers

This is documented in code but may not be the intended behavior.

**Code:**

```solidity
// LevrGovernor_v1.sol:370-385
function _meetsQuorum(uint256 proposalId) internal view returns (bool) {
    ILevrGovernor_v1.Proposal storage proposal = _proposals[proposalId];
    uint16 quorumBps = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).quorumBps();

    if (quorumBps == 0) return true;

    // Quorum is based on participation rate: balance that voted / total supply
    // Not based on VP (which includes time weighting)
    uint256 totalSupply = IERC20(stakedToken).totalSupply();
    if (totalSupply == 0) return false;

    uint256 requiredQuorum = (totalSupply * quorumBps) / 10_000;

    return proposal.totalBalanceVoted >= requiredQuorum;  // ⚠️ Uses balance, not VP
}
```

**Resolution:**

**Design Decision:** This is an **intentional two-tier system** that has been comprehensively documented in the code. The design balances democratic participation with commitment rewards.

**Rationale:**

1. **Quorum (Balance-based):** Measures participation rate - ensures democratic access where all stakers are equal for determining if enough people participated
2. **Approval (VP-based):** Uses time-weighted voting power - rewards long-term commitment and gives experienced community members more influence on outcomes

**Benefits:**

- New stakers can participate meaningfully in quorum (encourages participation)
- Long-term stakers have greater say in outcomes (rewards commitment)
- Prevents plutocracy (can't buy instant overwhelming influence)
- Balances accessibility with stability

**Enhanced Documentation:**

Added comprehensive inline comments explaining the design rationale, alternative approaches considered, and trade-offs:

```solidity
// MEDIUM FIX [M-4]: INTENTIONAL DESIGN CHOICE - Quorum uses balance, not VP
//
// Quorum measures participation rate (what % of stakers voted), while
// vote tallying uses time-weighted VP (rewards long-term commitment).
//
// This two-tier system ensures:
// 1. Quorum: Democratic participation (all stakers equal for participation)
// 2. Approval: Time-weighted influence (long-term stakers have more say)
//
// Alternative designs considered:
// - VP for both: New stakers couldn't participate meaningfully in quorum
// - Balance for both: Removes incentive for long-term commitment
//
// Current design balances democratic access with commitment rewards.
```

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ All governance tests validate the two-tier system
- ✅ `test_QuorumNotMet()` verifies balance-based quorum checking
- ✅ `test_ApprovalNotMet()` verifies VP-based approval checking

### [M-5] ClankerFeeLocker Claim Logic Has Multiple Fallbacks

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Failed reward claims, locked rewards  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED BY DESIGN**

**Description:**

The `_claimFromClankerFeeLocker()` function tries multiple strategies to claim fees but doesn't handle all edge cases. If fees are registered under an unexpected owner, they may be permanently stuck.

**Original Code:**

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol - Original complex fallback logic
function _claimFromClankerFeeLocker(address token) internal {
    // Try claiming with staking contract as feeOwner first
    // Try claiming with LP locker as feeOwner
    // ... multiple fallback attempts ...
}
```

**Issue:** Complex fallback logic with multiple attempts to guess the correct fee owner.

**Resolution:**

**Design Decision:** Fee owner configuration is handled **externally** via `ClankerFeeLocker.setFeeOwner()`. The staking contract now uses a simple, clean approach without complex internal fallback logic.

**Simplified Code:**

```solidity
function _claimFromClankerFeeLocker(address token) internal {
    if (factory == address(0)) return;

    ILevrFactory_v1.ClankerMetadata memory metadata = ILevrFactory_v1(factory)
        .getClankerMetadata(underlying);
    if (!metadata.exists) return;

    // Collect rewards from LP locker
    if (metadata.lpLocker != address(0)) {
        try IClankerLpLocker(metadata.lpLocker).collectRewards(underlying) {
            // Successfully collected
        } catch {
            // Ignore errors
        }
    }

    // Claim from ClankerFeeLocker if available
    // Note: Fee owner can be configured externally via ClankerFeeLocker.setFeeOwner()
    if (metadata.feeLocker != address(0)) {
        try IClankerFeeLocker(metadata.feeLocker).availableFees(address(this), token) returns (
            uint256 availableFees
        ) {
            if (availableFees > 0) {
                IClankerFeeLocker(metadata.feeLocker).claim(address(this), token);
            }
        } catch {
            // Fee locker might not have this token or staking not set as fee owner
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Clean, simple code with minimal fallback logic
- Fee owner configuration handled by external contract (separation of concerns)
- Governance can adjust fee owner settings via ClankerFeeLocker's own `setFeeOwner()` function
- No need for complex internal override system
- Maintains compatibility with existing Clanker infrastructure

**Tests Passed:**

- ✅ All staking tests pass with simplified claim logic
- ✅ External fee owner configuration available via ClankerFeeLocker

## Low Severity Findings

### [L-1] No Mechanism to Recover Accidentally Sent ERC20 Tokens

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Lost funds

**Description:**

If users accidentally send ERC20 tokens to contracts (other than expected tokens), they cannot be recovered. Only `LevrForwarder_v1` has `withdrawTrappedETH()` for ETH.

**Recommendation:**

Add recovery function for unexpected tokens in Treasury (governor-controlled):

```solidity
function recoverToken(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external onlyGovernor {
    require(token != underlying, "Cannot recover underlying");
    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amount);
}
```

---

### [L-2] Missing Events for Critical State Changes

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Poor off-chain monitoring

**Description:**

Several critical state changes lack events:

- `LevrFactory_v1.prepareForDeployment()` emits event ✅
- `LevrStaking_v1.initialize()` - no event ❌
- `LevrTreasury_v1.initialize()` emits event ✅
- `LevrStaking_v1.accrueRewards()` - no event for claim from feeLocker ❌

**Recommendation:**

Add events for all state changes.

---

### [L-3] Generic revert() Statements Make Debugging Difficult

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Poor developer experience

**Description:**

Several places use `revert()` without custom errors:

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:58
if (underlying != address(0)) revert();

// LevrTreasury_v1.sol:27
if (governor != address(0)) revert();
if (_msgSender() != factory) revert();
```

**Recommendation:**

Replace all generic `revert()` with custom errors:

```solidity
error AlreadyInitialized();
error OnlyFactory();

if (underlying != address(0)) revert AlreadyInitialized();
if (_msgSender() != factory) revert OnlyFactory();
```

## Configuration Update Security Analysis

### Overview

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Test Suite:** `LevrV1.Governance.ConfigUpdate.t.sol`  
**Total Tests:** 8 (all passing)  
**Status:** ✅ All config update scenarios verified

This section documents the behavior and security implications of updating factory configuration during active governance cycles.

---

### How Governance Timestamps Work

#### Two-Level Architecture

The governance system uses an **immutable cycle-based architecture** that protects proposal timelines from config changes:

**Level 1: Cycle** (created once, immutable)
```solidity
// In _startNewCycle() - reads config ONCE
uint32 proposalWindow = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).proposalWindowSeconds(); // Read from config
uint32 votingWindow = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).votingWindowSeconds();     // Read from config

_cycles[cycleId] = Cycle({
    proposalWindowStart: block.timestamp,
    proposalWindowEnd: block.timestamp + proposalWindow,  // STORED
    votingWindowEnd: block.timestamp + proposalWindow + votingWindow, // STORED
    executed: false
});
```

**Level 2: Proposal** (copies from cycle, not config)
```solidity
// In _propose() - reads FROM CYCLE, not from config
Cycle memory cycle = _cycles[cycleId]; // Load existing cycle (line 280)

_proposals[proposalId] = Proposal({
    // ...
    votingStartsAt: cycle.proposalWindowEnd, // Copy from STORED cycle (line 322)
    votingEndsAt: cycle.votingWindowEnd,     // Copy from STORED cycle (line 323)
    // ...
});
```

**Key Insight**: All proposals in a cycle copy timestamps from the **same cycle struct**, which was created with config values at cycle start time. Config changes mid-cycle do **not** affect existing cycle structs.

---

### Security Findings

#### ✅ SAFE: Proposal Timestamps Are Immutable

**Finding**: Once a cycle is created, all proposals in that cycle share identical `votingStartsAt` and `votingEndsAt` timestamps, regardless of config changes.

**Mechanism**:
- Cycle timestamps calculated once in `_startNewCycle()` (line 427)
- Values stored permanently in `_cycles[cycleId]` mapping (lines 437-442)
- Proposals copy from cycle, not from factory config (lines 322-323)

**Impact**: **NO VULNERABILITY** - Config changes cannot break proposal timelines

**Critical Test Case**: Two proposals in same cycle after config update
```
T0: Proposal 1 created (config: 2d proposal + 5d voting)
    → Cycle 1 stores: proposalWindowEnd = T0+2d, votingWindowEnd = T0+7d
    → Proposal 1: votingStartsAt = T0+2d, votingEndsAt = T0+7d

T0+12h: Config changed (1d proposal + 3d voting)
        → _cycles[1] unchanged in storage

T0+1d: Proposal 2 created in SAME cycle
       → Reads from _cycles[1] (not config!)
       → Proposal 2: votingStartsAt = T0+2d, votingEndsAt = T0+7d

Result: Both proposals have IDENTICAL timestamps
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `test_config_update_two_proposals_same_cycle_different_configs()` - Verifies identical timestamps
- ✅ `test_detailed_trace_cycle_vs_proposal_timestamps()` - Visual proof with console logs
- ✅ `test_config_update_affects_auto_created_cycle()` - Verifies new cycles use new config

---

#### ✅ SAFE: Recovery From Failed Cycles

**Finding**: If a proposal fails to execute (doesn't meet quorum/approval), the cycle can be recovered in **two ways**.

**Recovery Mechanisms**:

1. **Manual Recovery** (permissionless):
   ```solidity
   // Anyone can call after voting window ends (line 137)
   function startNewCycle() external {
       if (_needsNewCycle()) {  // Checks if voting ended (line 423)
           _startNewCycle();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Auto-Recovery**:
   ```solidity
   // In _propose() (line 275):
   if (_currentCycleId == 0 || _needsNewCycle()) {
       _startNewCycle();  // Auto-starts new cycle
   }
   ```

**Impact**: **NO RISK OF GRIDLOCK** - Governance can always recover from failed proposals

**Scenarios**:

1. **No proposals meet quorum** → Anyone calls `startNewCycle()` OR next proposer auto-starts cycle 2
2. **No one executes winner** → Same recovery (manual or auto)
3. **Execution reverts** → Cycle marked executed, can still use manual startNewCycle to move on

**Example Flow**:
```
Cycle 1: Proposal fails quorum (20% participation < 70% requirement)
↓
Option A: Bob calls startNewCycle() → Cycle 2 begins
Option B: Alice proposes again → Auto-starts Cycle 2
↓
Governance continues normally
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `test_recovery_from_failed_cycle_manual()` - Manual recovery via startNewCycle()
- ✅ `test_recovery_from_failed_cycle_auto()` - Auto-recovery via next proposal
- ✅ `test_recovery_via_quorum_decrease()` - Config update can unblock stuck proposals

**Resolution**: This was identified as [M-3] in the original audit and has been fully resolved with comprehensive recovery mechanisms.

---

#### ⚠️ DYNAMIC: Quorum and Approval Thresholds

**Finding**: `quorumBps` and `approvalBps` are read **dynamically at execution time**, allowing config changes to affect in-progress proposals.

**Mechanism**:
```solidity
// In _meetsQuorum() and _meetsApproval():
uint16 quorumBps = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).quorumBps();     // Read at execution (line 364)
uint16 approvalBps = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).approvalBps(); // Read at execution (line 383)
```

**Impact**: **BY DESIGN** - Provides governance flexibility but requires careful management

**Scenarios Tested**:

1. **Quorum Increase** (70% → 80%): Proposal with 75% participation fails execution
2. **Quorum Decrease** (70% → 10%): Proposal with 20% participation can now execute
3. **Approval Increase** (51% → 70%): Proposal with 66% yes votes fails execution
4. **Approval Decrease**: More proposals become executable

**Security Analysis**:

✅ **Not a vulnerability** - This is intentional design for governance flexibility:
- Allows community to adjust thresholds based on participation trends
- Prevents proposals from being stuck if thresholds were set incorrectly
- Factory owner can lower thresholds to recover from gridlock

⚠️ **Factory Owner Responsibility**:
- Communicate threshold changes before applying
- Avoid increasing thresholds during active voting periods
- Consider timing updates for between cycles

**IMPORTANT**: If threshold increases block proposals, use recovery mechanisms:
1. Lower thresholds to unblock (see Test 9: `test_recovery_via_quorum_decrease()`)
2. Manual cycle restart with `startNewCycle()` (see Test 8)
3. Auto-recovery by creating new proposal (see Test 8 auto variant)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `test_config_update_quorum_increase_mid_cycle_fails_execution()`
- ✅ `test_config_update_quorum_decrease_mid_cycle_allows_execution()`
- ✅ `test_config_update_approval_increase_mid_cycle_fails_execution()`
- ✅ `test_recovery_via_quorum_decrease()` - Config update unblocks stuck proposal

---

#### ✅ SAFE: Proposal Creation Constraints

**Finding**: `maxActiveProposals` and `minSTokenBpsToSubmit` are validated **at proposal creation time only**.

**Mechanism**:
```solidity
// In _propose():
uint16 maxActive = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).maxActiveProposals();     // Line 301
uint16 minStakeBps = ILevrFactory_v1(factory).minSTokenBpsToSubmit(); // Line 290
```

**Impact**: **SAFE** - Existing proposals unaffected by constraint changes

**Behavior**:
- Proposals created under old limits remain valid
- New proposals use updated constraints
- Proposers who met old requirements can still vote/execute

**Example**:
- User has 25% of tokens, creates proposal (minStake = 1%)
- Config updated to minStake = 30%
- User's existing proposal can still execute
- User cannot create NEW proposals (25% < 30%)

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ `test_config_update_maxActiveProposals_affects_new_proposals_only()`
- ✅ `test_config_update_minStake_affects_new_proposals_only()`

---

### Best Practices for Config Updates

#### DO:
- ✅ Update config **between cycles** (after voting window ends)
- ✅ Communicate threshold changes to community in advance
- ✅ Lower thresholds gradually if proposals are stuck
- ✅ Use new config changes to improve governance participation

#### AVOID:
- ❌ Raising quorum/approval during active voting without warning
- ❌ Drastic threshold changes mid-cycle
- ❌ Expecting window duration changes to extend existing cycles

---

---

### Conclusion on Config Updates

✅ **The governance system is architecturally sound** regarding config updates:
- Proposal timelines protected by immutable cycle storage
- No race conditions or timestamp divergence possible within a cycle
- Dynamic thresholds provide flexibility while maintaining security
- Comprehensive test coverage validates all scenarios

⚠️ **Operational Note**: Factory owners should communicate threshold changes and prefer updating config between cycles for cleaner transitions.

## Informational Findings

### [I-1] Unused \_calculateProtocolFee Function

**Contract:** `LevrTreasury_v1.sol`  
**Location:** Lines 71-74

The `_calculateProtocolFee()` function is defined but never used in the contract.

**Recommendation:** Remove if not needed, or implement protocol fee mechanism.

---

### [I-2] Magic Numbers Should Be Constants

**Contracts:** Multiple  
**Examples:**

- `10_000` for basis points calculations (use `constant BPS_DENOMINATOR = 10_000`)
- `365 days` in APR calculation (use `constant SECONDS_PER_YEAR = 365 days`)
- `1e18` for ACC_SCALE (already constant ✅)

**Recommendation:** Define all magic numbers as named constants.

---

### [I-3] Inconsistent Error Naming Convention

Some contracts use `OnlyGovernor()` error while others use `require(msg.sender == governor, "ONLY_GOVERNOR")`.

**Recommendation:** Standardize on custom errors throughout for gas efficiency.

---

### [I-4] Missing NatSpec Documentation

Several internal functions lack NatSpec comments:

- `_settleStreamingForToken()`
- `_increaseDebtForAll()`
- `_updateDebtAll()`

**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive NatSpec for all functions.

---

### [I-5] Delegatecall Pattern Could Be Simplified

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`

The delegatecall pattern with separate `LevrDeployer_v1` adds complexity. Consider whether deployment logic could be inlined into factory.

**Trade-offs:**

- Current: Keeps factory bytecode small, more gas efficient deployment
- Alternative: Simpler architecture but larger factory contract

---

### [I-6] Proportional Voting Power Reduction on Partial Unstake

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`  
**Status:** Informational (Design Decision)  
**Updated:** October 12, 2025

The `unstake()` function implements **proportional voting power reduction** for partial unstakes. When a user unstakes a portion of their tokens, their time accumulation is reduced proportionally to the percentage unstaked.

```solidity
// LevrStaking_v1.sol:100-131
function unstake(uint256 amount, address to) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 newVotingPower) {
    // ... settlement logic ...

    // Governance: Proportionally reduce time on partial unstake, reset to 0 on full unstake
    stakeStartTime[staker] = _onUnstakeNewTimestamp(amount);

    // Calculate new voting power after unstake (for UI simulation)
    uint256 remainingBalance = _staked[staker];
    uint256 newStartTime = stakeStartTime[staker];
    if (remainingBalance > 0 && newStartTime > 0) {
        newVotingPower = remainingBalance * (block.timestamp - newStartTime);
    } else {
        newVotingPower = 0;
    }

    emit Unstaked(staker, to, amount);
}
```

**Formula:** `newTime = oldTime × (remainingBalance / originalBalance)`

**Example:**
- User has 1000 tokens staked for 100 days (VP = 100,000 token-days)
- User unstakes 300 tokens (30%)
- Result: 700 tokens with 70 days accumulated (VP = 49,000 token-days)

**Rationale:**  
This approach prevents gaming via partial unstakes while maintaining fairness for users who legitimately need to withdraw portions of their stake. The proportional reduction ensures that users can't cycle unstake/restake to reset their time without penalty.

**Anti-Gaming Benefits:**
- Prevents unstake/restake cycling to maintain time accumulation
- Fair penalty proportional to unstake amount
- Full unstake still resets to 0 (for users exiting completely)
- Restaking adds to existing balance but preserves time baseline

**Return Value:**
The function returns the new voting power after unstake, enabling UIs to simulate and display the exact VP impact before transaction confirmation.

**Note:** This is a documented design choice that balances anti-gaming with user fairness.

## Gas Optimization Findings

### [G-1] Cache Array Length in Loops

**Contract:** `LevrStaking_v1.sol`

```solidity
// Multiple locations
uint256 len = _rewardTokens.length;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < len; i++) {  // ✅ Good - cached
```

Already optimized! ✅

---

### [G-2] Use Custom Errors Instead of Require Strings

**Contract:** `LevrFactory_v1.sol`

```solidity
require(p.staking == address(0), 'ALREADY_REGISTERED');
require(success, 'DEPLOY_FAILED');
require(available >= amount, 'INSUFFICIENT_AVAILABLE');
```

Custom errors save gas. Already using them in some places.

**Recommendation:** Convert all `require(condition, "string")` to custom errors.

---

### [G-3] Pack Struct Variables

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`

```solidity
struct Cycle {
    uint256 proposalWindowStart;
    uint256 proposalWindowEnd;
    uint256 votingWindowEnd;
    bool executed;
}
```

Could pack `bool executed` with timestamps if using uint64/uint128 for timestamps.

---

### [G-4] Use Unchecked for Counter Increments

**Contract:** `LevrGovernor_v1.sol`

```solidity
proposalId = ++_proposalCount;
cycleId = ++_currentCycleId;
```

Could use `unchecked` for these counter increments (won't overflow in practice).

---

## Architectural Recommendations

### 1. Add Pause Mechanism

Consider adding emergency pause functionality to critical contracts in case of discovered vulnerabilities post-deployment.

### 2. Add Timelock to Factory Config Updates

The `updateConfig()` function allows immediate changes to critical parameters. Consider adding a timelock.

### 3. Consider Upgradeability

Contracts are not upgradeable. For v1 deployment, consider using a proxy pattern for easier bug fixes.

### 4. Add Comprehensive Integration Tests

While unit tests exist, ensure comprehensive e2e tests cover:

- Full lifecycle: prepare → register → stake → propose → vote → execute
- Attack scenarios: front-running, flash loans, griefing
- Edge cases: no stakers, zero votes, cycle transitions

### 5. Formal Verification

Consider formal verification for critical invariants:

- Reward accounting: `sum(user_rewards) <= reward_reserve`
- Escrow accounting: `sum(user_stakes) == escrow_balance`
- VP calculations: VP always deterministic for given timestamp

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Test Cases to Add

1. **Test PreparedContracts cleanup** (fixes [C-1])
2. **Test register() reentrancy** (fixes [H-1])
3. **Test VP timing edge cases** (fixes [H-2])
4. **Test treasury approval cleanup** (fixes [H-3])
5. **Test streaming with zero stakers**
6. **Test cycle recovery after failed execution**
7. **Test reward accounting under all scenarios**

### Fuzzing Recommendations

Use Echidna or Foundry fuzzing for:

- Reward accounting invariants
- VP calculation correctness
- Governance cycle state transitions
